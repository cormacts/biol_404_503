## Testable hypotheses:
# The functional roles of microbiota associated with Macrocystis and Nereocystis differ due to the distinct life histories of these two kelp species:
# Genes associated with nitrogen reduction will be more prevalent in Nereocystis due to its high rate of growth, being an annual kelp species.

# The functional roles of microbiota associated with younger, meristematic blade tissue differ from those associated with older, apical blade tissue in Nereocystis luetkeana:
# Genes associated with nitrogen reduction will be present at a higher proportion in microbial communities at the meristem as this is where growth is occurring in the kelp individual, creating biological available nitrogen in these regions.
